# HyperScape 🚀  
**Hyperspectral Image Classification using Deep Learning**

HyperScape is a deep learning-based project that focuses on classifying hyperspectral images (HSI) by capturing both **spectral and spatial features**. The project explores multiple CNN architectures including a **custom 2D CNN**, **VGG16 with transfer learning**, and a **3D CNN** to achieve high accuracy and generalization across datasets like **Indian Pines** and **Salinas-A**.

## 📂 Datasets

- **Indian Pines**:  
  - Size: 145 × 145 pixels  
  - Bands: 224 (200 used)  
  - Classes: 16 land-cover types

- **Salinas-A** *(used for generalization)*:  
  - Size: 83 × 86 pixels  
  - Bands: 204  
  - Classes: 6 vegetation types

Both datasets were captured by the **AVIRIS** sensor.

- Spectral normalization
- PCA for dimensionality reduction (for VGG)
- Patch extraction (e.g., 11×11 or 5×5×30)
- Data augmentation: rotation & flipping
